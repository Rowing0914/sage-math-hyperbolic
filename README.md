# SageMath Hyperbolic

### Background
This repository utilizes SageMath, a Python-based library for scientific computing, to explore hyperbolic geometry. SageMath offers a comprehensive suite of pre-implemented functions suitable for mathematical analysis and visualization.

### How to Use
Upon accessing the provided URLs, you will encounter a visualization interface showcasing geometric constructions in hyperbolic space, exemplified by the Coxeter 4-gon depicted below. The script responsible for generating these visualizations is located at the top of the page.

To initiate the interactive experience:
1. Input the desired x and y coordinates for the Base-point.
2. Press Enter to trigger the script, updating the visualization accordingly.

### Demo
- **num_sides**: Number of sides for the base polygon.
- **i_angle**: Angle of each corner.
- **base_pt_x, base_pt_y**: Cartesian coordinates of the Base-point of reflections.
- **if_plot_sides**: Whether to plot the sides of the base polygon.
- **if_plot_reflect_1st_sides**: Whether to plot the first reflected sides.
- **if_plot_reflect_1st_pBase**: Whether to plot the first reflected base point.
- **if_plot_reflect_2nd_sides**: Whether to plot the second reflected sides.
- **if_plot_reflect_2nd_pBase**: Whether to plot the second reflected base point.
- **if_plot_perp_bisec**: Whether to plot the perpendicular bisector between the base point and the second reflected base points.
